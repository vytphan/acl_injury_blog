    "title": "ACL Injury Risk in Female Athletes: A Data Science Approach",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries occur at two to eight times higher rates in female athletes compared to male athletes, especially in cutting sports like soccer, basketball, and ultimate frisbee (Tjong 2024; Allen 2025). Research shows that 55-70% of ACL injuries happen without contact—during sudden stops, pivots, or single-leg landings after jumps (Chia et al. 2022; Koga et al. 2010). Beyond immediate pain and surgery, ACL injuries often disrupt athletic careers. Athletes who return to sport after ACL reconstruction face elevated reinjury risk, with studies reporting second ACL injury rates ranging from 6% to 30% depending on age and activity level (Wright et al. 2007; Paterno et al. 2012).\nThe challenge is: how can we reduce ACL injury rates in female athletes?\n Photo by UBC Women’s Ultimate ((ubcwultimate?)).

    "section": "3. Female-Specific Contextual Factors",
    "text": "3. Female-Specific Contextual Factors\nThis is what makes the model distinct. Research has demonstrated an association between hormonal fluctuations and ACL injury risk in female athletes (Hewett, Myer, and Ford 2006). Hormonal changes across the menstrual cycle may influence ligament flexibility, neuromuscular coordination, and fatigue perception.\nThe model incorporates two key types of contextual information:\n\na. Hormonal Context (Self-Reported Information)\nSince directly measuring hormone levels requires blood tests and is impractical for regular tracking, the model uses information athletes can report themselves:\n\nMenstrual cycle phase\nHormonal contraceptive use\nCycle regularity\nSymptom severity (cramps, bloating, mood changes)\nPerceived coordination or joint stability\n\nResearch shows these measures can be linked to changes in injury risk patterns (Herzberg et al. 2017).\n\n\nb. Stress and Recovery Status\nShort-term readiness indicators that fluctuate more rapidly:\n\nSleep duration and quality\nDaily stress ratings\nFatigue and muscle soreness\nMood or irritability\nTime since last high-intensity session\nResting heart rate (when available)\n\nBy combining stable physical metrics with dynamic contextual information, the model reflects both an athlete’s baseline risk profile and their current readiness state. This approach acknowledges that identical training activities may carry different risk levels depending on recovery, stress, and hormonal context."
